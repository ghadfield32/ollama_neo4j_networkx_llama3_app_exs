      " <think>\n",
      "Okay, I need to create a Python function called average_team_points that calculates the average NBA team points total per season for a given year, like '2021-22'. The user wants this function to use the nba_api library and specifically the LeagueDashTeamStats endpoint.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should import the necessary modules. Since we're using nba_api, I'll need to import the client from nba_api, probably just as Client. Also, from the statistics endpoint, I'll need client as well because we'll be working with stats clients in our code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the function will take a single parameter: season. That's straightforward. The function should return the average points per team for that season.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember that NBA data is structured into different endpoints and seasons have specific codes. For example, '2021-22' corresponds to the 2021-22 season in the nba_api system, which I think has a code of 345. So, when making API calls, we need to specify this code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, using the LeagueDashTeamStats endpoint, I can get the team points for each game and then aggregate them to find the total points per team. The end_date parameter is important here; setting it to '_nullable' allows us to fetch all available data without needing a specific end date.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll write an async function because nba_api's endpoints are asynchronous. Inside this function, I'll create an instance of LeagueDashTeamStats, passing in the client and the season code. Then, I'll set the start_date and end_date as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "After fetching the data using the get_data() method, which returns a coroutine object, I need to handle it properly within an async with ... await block.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once I have all the data, I should process each game's team points. For each entry in the data, there's a 'PLUS_MINUS' field that contains the points for both teams combined. So, I'll extract these values, sum them up across all games, and then calculate the average by dividing by the number of games.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but sometimes if no games are found, I should handle that case to avoid division by zero. If there are no team stats available, maybe return 0 or None as a default.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I need to structure this into a function that can be called with the season string and returns the average points per game. The user will have to install nba_api if they haven't already, so I'll include a note about that in the instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also test the function with known seasons to ensure it's working correctly. For example, I can check the 2018-19 season where the average was around 114 points per game. If the function returns that value for '2018-19', it gives me confidence it's correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that covers all the steps. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.\n",
      "</think>\n",

      "To create a Python function that calculates the average NBA team points total per season using the `nba_api` library, follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n",
      "1. **Import Necessary Modules**: We need to import the NBA API client and specifically the statistics endpoint for data retrieval.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Define the Function**: Create a function named `average_team_points` that accepts a single parameter, `season`, which is a string representing the season in 'YYYY-YYYY' format.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Set Up the API Call**: Use the `LeagueDashTeamStats` class from the `nba_api.stats.endpoints` module to fetch team statistics for the specified season.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Fetch Season Data**: Extract the data for the specified season and process it to calculate the average points per game.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Calculate Average Points Per Game**: Sum all the team points across all games for the season, then divide by the number of games played.\n",
      "\n",

      "- **Function Definition**: The function takes a single parameter, `season`, which should be a string in 'YYYY-YYYY' format.\n",

      "- **Processing Game Data**: For each game entry, we extract the total points (PLUS_MINUS) and accumulate them along with the number of games played.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Calculating Average**: After processing all games, the average points per game are calculated by dividing the total points by the number of games. If no games were found, the function returns 0.0 to avoid division by zero.\n",
