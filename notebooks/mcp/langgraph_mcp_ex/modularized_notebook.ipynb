      "<think>\n",
      "Alright, so I need to figure out LeBron James' average points per game (PPG) over his NBA career using only the regular season data. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I know that PPG is calculated by taking the total number of points a player scores in a season and dividing it by the number of games they played in that season. But wait, does that give me the average for his entire career? Hmm, no, maybe I need to consider all the regular season games he played across his entire NBA career.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I think I need to get all the regular season statistics for LeBron James from each season he played in the NBA. That means I'll have to sum up his total points from every regular season game and also count how many regular season games he played throughout his entire career.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once I have those two numbers—the total points and the total number of regular season games—I can divide the total points by the total number of games to get his average PPG for his NBA career based solely on regular season data.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, do I know how to access all these statistics? I guess if there's a tool or function that provides regular season stats for each player, I can use that. Let me see... There is this `nba_player_stats_regularseason` function that seems designed for exactly this purpose. It probably takes a player\\'s name and returns their regular season statistics.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, first step: Use the function to get LeBron James' regular season stats. That should give me both his total points and the number of games he played in the regular season across his career.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to extract those two pieces of information—total points and total regular season games—from the output of that function.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I'll perform the division: total points divided by total regular season games. That should give me his average PPG for the regular season portion of his NBA career.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me think if there are any potential issues here. Maybe some years he didn't play in the regular season? Or did he miss any significant time due to injury? If that's the case, I might need to adjust the number of games he played accordingly. But since we're focusing only on regular season data and assuming the function already accounts for that, maybe it's okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, what if the data isn't available for all his seasons? The function should handle missing data gracefully, right? Or does it return null or zero in those cases? I'm not sure, but perhaps the function is robust enough to deal with incomplete data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing: Are the stats provided per season already aggregated? If so, then summing them up would just be adding them all together. But if they're presented on a per-season basis without total sums, I might need to iterate through each season's stats and accumulate the totals manually.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe the function returns an annual breakdown of statistics for each season LeBron played in. In that case, I'd have to loop through each year's data, sum up all his points across those years, and also count how many regular season games he played in total during those years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, sounds like a plan. So, first, get the list of seasons LeBron played in, then for each season, retrieve his regular season stats, accumulate the points and game counts accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, I think that makes sense. Now, let's outline this process:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Use `nba_player_stats_regularseason(\"LeBron James\")` to get an array of regular season statistics for each year LeBron played.\n",
      "2. Initialize two variables: one for total points (starting at 0) and another for total regular season games (also starting at 0).\n",
      "3. Loop through each season's data in the array:\n",
      "   a. Add the points from that season to the total points.\n",
      "   b. Add the number of regular season games played in that season to the total regular season games.\n",
      "4. After processing all seasons, divide the total points by the total regular season games to get LeBron James' average PPG for his NBA career based on regular season data.\n",
      "5. Round the result to two decimal places for a clean, readable number.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think this approach should work. Now, I'll proceed to write the Python code that implements these steps using the `nba_player_stats_regularseason` function.\n",
